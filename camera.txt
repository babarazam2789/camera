Performing camera connection and capturing image using Raspberry PI.

1.	Open terminal and type sudo raspi-config and press Enter.
2.	Use the down arrow to select 5 Interfacing Options.
3.	Arrow down to P4 SPI.
4.	Select yes when it asks you to enable SPI.
5.	Also select yes when it asks about automatically loading the kernel module.
6.	Use the right arrow to select the <Finish> button.
7.	Select yes when it asks to reboot.
8.	Also enable P1 Camera.
9.	Select yes when it asks ‘would you like the camera interface to be enabled?’.
10.	Exit raspi-config and accept to reboot the device.

The first thing you can try is to simply take a picture of the image seen by the camera.

Raspistill -o image.jpg

As soon as you hit the ENTER key, you’ll see a large picture of what the camera sees appear on-screen. This is called the live preview and, unless you tell raspistill otherwise, it will last for five seconds. After those five seconds are up, the camera will capture a single still picture and save it in your home folder under the name image.jpg.

With -o you define the target file name (where the pictures will be saved). It’s possible to use a file name including the path, for example:

Raspistill -o Desktop/image.jpg




Control the camera from the python :

Sudo apt-get update
Sudo apt-get install python-picamera python3-picamera

code :

From picamera import PiCamera
From time import sleep

camera = PiCamera()
camera.start_preview(fullscreen=false, windows = (50,150,1024,576)
sleep(10)
camera.capture(‘test.jpg’)
camera.stop_preview()
